    <h1>A poem about the Arya's </h1>
    <h3>By Lachlan Lalor</h3>
    <p>Two young boys, both named Arya,<br>
Chased the wind through fields of marigold.<br>
Laughter echoed, wild and free,<br>
Two bright flames, brave and bold.<br>
<br>Hand in hand, they raced the sun,<br>
Through rivers, dreams, and endless skies.<br>
No names could ever set apart<br>
The kindred spark behind their eyes. </p>
